It was the final week of class, and yes, it's not the best class we've all taken, but considering it was Aaron's first time teaching an undergrad class, I thought he did a fantastic job. I won't go into details about suggestions for future iterations of the class, simply because the in-class survey already covered most of my thoughts, and students have given a lot of feedback through our individual surveys.

I enjoy meeting and knowing a lot more people this semester, and I definitely feel like I have learned a thing or two.
