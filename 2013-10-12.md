I thought this week is perhaps the best week in Stat 157 so far. We finally got some reproducible products 
going, and teams have finally been formed and are fully functional. On top of that, every single group's 
presentation blows me away, especially with those who have limited time but still decided to quickly learn 
and use Python over the weekend (props to y'all!).     

We also run into a few issues; in particular, one of my group members don't have a strong enough laptop to 
run a VM, so in the end, he wasn't able to fully participate in the project, but we were still having a 
blast doing everything and making sure he was not falling behind.    

The Github Issue Tracker has been great, and personally, I think people enjoy using it more than the IRC 
channel because most people here are somewhat familiar with tools like Piazza or Google Groups. Asking a 
random, kind stranger on an Internet Chat forum seems weird to most people, including myself, but it looks 
like we're going to get used to it sooner or later, so it's better to just use it now, I guess.    

I feel like group of 4 is a bit too small, and would love to have the size increased by one or so. 
Furthermore, fewer groups would allow more time for presentations (half of the groups run out of time on 
Tuesday afair). Also, allowing people to swtch between groups and roles would also help a lot, in terms 
of gaining new skills and meeting new people. But since good group is hard to formed, we can't probably 
afford to do that too often :-).    

Overall, it was an exciting week, and I look forward to seeing what's going to happen in the next few weeks.
