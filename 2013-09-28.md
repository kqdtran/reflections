I would say we just had another week goes by without must progress, those I must admit that I like 
the open discussions that we have in-class on Thursday. It's great to see people express their opinions 
and to be open about it.   

That said, I don't quite like the discussion on moving the due date of the reflection... I feel like 
it was a giant waste of time. Quite frankly, we are all adults now, and we should be responsible for 
something as simple as a deadline. What if, instead of Aaron, say your boss wants you to turn in a 
report at 5pm on Saturday, and that a late one would cost the company thousands of dollars? Would you 
bring up excuse like I'm too busy partying on Friday night and can't wake up in time to finish it?... 
As much as I love how the teaching staff are always open to feedback, this is something that they should 
be strict about. 

I feel like we should really get our feet wet at home by diving into the material already. Installation 
should really be done at home. Helping individual's need cannot be scale to a class of 40 people, and 
one day when this class expands to hundreds, it's simply impossible. That being said, I also don't think 
the teaching staff needs to write up detailed hand-holding instruction. All they need to do is point us in 
the right direction. The rest is up to the students, especially by utilizing their group's tech lead. 

On reproducibility: Contrary to a lot of people' opinions on Thursday, the word "reproducibility" was 
actually one of the reasons why I signed up for this class. Being a CS major, I've been through numerous 
occasions where I tried to reproduce someone's result, and failed miserably (hint: dependency hell). I've 
always wanted to make a template for everything, from my homework to my resume, even as far as a web app. 
That way, the next person (if not simply myself) who wants to reproduce the same result sometimes in the 
future could simply figure it out with almost no pain at all. I think reproducibility is a very important 
part of everything today, especially data science, and I'm glad we center our class around it. 

That being said, I'm sure we've all eager to do something, and most of us have not really seen how 
reproducibility is done in this class, except for the installing VM part... Looking forward to future 
weeks and the direction we are moving toward :-).
