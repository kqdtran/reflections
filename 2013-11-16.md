Aaron was away this week, and I feel like we were in a chaos. I'm quite disappointed that we didn't have 
any guest speakers this week as promised, and both class periods just turned out to be a group working session, 
where many people left early and/or didn't show up.

Perhaps this is just me, but the problem we as a class are facing right now, is that the roadblock ahead is 
just too much for us undergraduates to handle in our limited time. I feel like simply pointing people to 
resources like the D Lab doesn't really work, not because we don't go, but because some of us don't even 
know what to ask and where to begin. There are tons of LP solvers out there, and it's super easy to solve 
one these days, but the problem is how we are going to set up the problem in the first place... :(

I've heard from at least two people that they didn't gain anything from this class. This is really detrimental 
because a class like this should be fun and educational, yet I feel like the disorganization of the class 
was a major cause for the low momentum. In future offerings of this course, I really hope the instructors 
would iron out a syllabus before class so that everyone knows what to expect, instead of making changes as we 
go. While the latter is not necessarily bad (and in fact, that's pretty much the gameplan of most startups), 
we as students don't have 80 hours a week to devote to a 3-unit class like forming a new company, and as a 
result, some people just give up and feel discourage from coming to class.

The worst part about working on a product is that you don't believe in the product itself. I don't think 
any of us right now believes in what we can accomplish by the end of class, even after a huge shift in 
momentum last last Tuesday. But I may be very wrong... (which I hope I am)

As a group, I'll continue to meet with my teammates this weekend and see what we can do. We don't want to give 
up, but it's too painful to move forward. Hopefully the roadblock will soon go away...
