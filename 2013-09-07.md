* I think the firewall issue that prevents opening IPython notebook on my web broswer has been challenging. 
I spent a couple hours googling to no possible fix, but I think I will keep looking for now. 
I haven't tried the IRC channel for IPython yet, maybe that would be the next place to start.   
* The "Aha" moment was when I finally found a way to enter the BIOS settings on my Sony Vaio E Series. 
There was no instruction on the booting screen whatsoever, and there are tons of models on the E-series, 
which makes googling for solution almost impossible. I narrowed down to a few possible keys, 
and it turned out that a combination of F1 and F2 finally let me into the BIOS setting.   

  One other "Aha" moment would probably be finally being able to registering my username on the IRC. 
It may sound trivial to most, but after digging around, I finally found a 
[helpful guide](http://www.zantherus.com/community/topic/2635-howto-connect-to-irc-with-pidgin/) 
on how to do it on Ubuntu.   

* If I could start all over, I would slow myself down a little bit. I tend to press 'Next' without carefully
reading what is going on during installation, and that cost me once whilst installing Ubuntu Server. To those
who are still working on getting Ubuntu Server working, I would advise them to follow the instructions carefully. 
It's certainly not fun to get Ubuntu VM working, only to realize it's the Desktop version. Plus, if you need help, 
ask for it. There's no shy in not being able to install stuff here and there. Being a CS major myself, I still 
have trouble getting Ubuntu running inside Ubuntu D:
