* What's been challenging this week was forming new group, meeting new people, and especially helping 
everyone get on the same page. Being selected as a technical lead is a huge priviledge, but "with great
power comes great responsibility". I think in the end it works out pretty well, though there have been
multiple occassions where my group's members have troubles getting Vagrant running.

  It's also challenging to come to class, only to spend the majority of the time downloading (with very low
speed) and debugging. We already brought this up during the pluses and deltas session last Thursday, 
that download instructions and debugging can be shifted toward the student's side.

  Also, I think it would be really helpful if we get everyone on the same page by using a VM, for 
example, the one available with saasbook. Both CS186 and CS169 use it this semester, and having
everyone on the same VM is much easier than having different installation instructions with Vagrant, 
Git Bash, and whatnot. Once everyone gets on the VM, BAM!

* Aha moment: Not any this week I think. But meeting new people was surely fun, and it's super helpful 
to listen to classmates discussing the pluses and deltas. I appreciate how feedback-oriented both the 
class and the instructors are, which is surely a nice wind-of-change compared to some of the bureaucratic 
lowerdiv classes here :p

* Advice: maybe having one single VM like I mentioned above could be helpful. Also, the staff could send 
installation instructions to students before classes, so that we can focus on the actual implementation 
and the material during valuable class time. Better yet, put the installation instructions as "homework", 
in the sense that people have to actively google or get on IRC to get help until they get everything 
required installed. That way, everyone will be on the same page at the start of every class.
