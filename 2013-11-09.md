This was an extremely exciting week, and I want to take back what I said in last week's reflection. It's amazing 
how the entire class was able to put up, IMO, a fantastic presentation on Tuesday. The presenters, especially 
Carl, put in a lot of work to "string" all the groups together, and I think every single person in this class 
deserves a round of applause.

However, let's hold celebration back for a moment. There are still a lot to be done in the next 4-5 weeks. What 
happened on Tuesday cleared any remaining doubts that with hard work, everything is possible. I don't think 
Aaron was the only one who was worried about us being on the right track and getting to the end goal. I know 
many people, including myself, were, too. Since we have now established the basic workflow, it would be much 
smoother, though not necessarily easier, moving forward.

I really enjoy working with my both my new vertical group and my horizontal group (and of course, the class as a 
whole). We set up multiple meetings, including a few with Aaron and with Chris. By attending these OHs, I come 
out and have a much better understanding of our goals and plans on how to get there. As long as we stay on the 
"critical path", I believe our class will pull through and finish with a fantastic deliverable at the Data 
Science Fair

**AHA moment**: I would say the presentation on Tuesday blew me away. I kinda dig the idea of a self-running 
class, where students come up with plans of actions and execute based on that. In the real world, there won't 
always be a supervisor/professor to tell you what to do and what needs to be done. The fact that some students 
take the intiative, step up, and drive the class really inspires me, and I think the best part of a Berkeley 
education experience is indeed the people here.

I haven't said this for a while, but now I definitely look forward to the last four weeks of the class. I'm sure 
it will definitely be amazing, regardless of our end product. But of course, I know everyone of us will put 
110% effort into this to make it an amazing experience, especially when most of us are in our last years of 
college. :-)
