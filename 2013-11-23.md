This week was much like last week and the week before in the sense that I feel we are still quite far 
away from what we need to accomplish. My group met for a few hours during the weekend and tackled the 
problem together, and we were able to plot some aftershocks for curve eyeballing purpose. It seems 
extremely hard to deduce anything from just the plot, so it's very likely that we'll have to switch to 
the optimization approach.

We had an interesting conference call with Prof. Luen on Tuesday, though I can tell that not everyone 
in the class is interested in what we're doing based on the number of people attending the call - less 
than a handful. Aaron also mentioned the AWS grant that could greatly speed up computational time, 
though this has been a problem for a while. Our roadblock was really not computational time or finding 
the right software to do something - it has always been setting up the correct problem to solve. The linear 
optimization problem is not hard to show graphically or mathematically (think Simplex and polyhedron's 
vertices), but it's very hard to set up the correct objective problem and constraints...

That said, with Prof. Luen joining the game, maybe we'll be able to crack something... My group plans to 
meet with Aaron on Friday, and then meets amongst us sometime on the weekend, so maybe this reflection 
will be updated with new contents by then.
