Yet another exciting week of Stat 157! I think the next project definitely looks really awesome, 
and I can't wait to get my hands dirty with some Pandas and interactive map plotting using Matplotlib. 
Most importantly, we finally get to play with some real world data, which are known to be super messy.   

On Thursday, Prof. Stark gave a third lecture on the correlation between earthquakes and rainfalls. 
To be honest, without a substantial stats background like most people in the class, I often feel lost 
at times, though the lecture was entertaining and enlightening. I'm still curious about how we are going 
to do all these complicated distributions and hypothesis testings in Python, but I guess that's why I'm 
in this class in the first place.

* **Roadblock**: the pandas version on our Ubuntu VM was outdated, and it has some missing functionalities. 
To this end, I'd suggest installing pandas via pip instead.    

Also, the geojson file didn't seem to match `read_json` capability (my guess is that `read_json` is only 
recently available in the latest release of pandas, so it's not super robust yet). One workaround I found 
is to use the built-in json module instead, and read & extract the data in the traditional way. It's not 
really elegant, but it works. Shipping beats perfection!    

I look forward to working on this project with my teammates, and we'll see what comes next!
