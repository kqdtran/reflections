Not much to say this week since we have Thursday off for Thanksgiving. On Tuesday, Fernando Perez 
gave what I thought the best lecture in our class so far. I expect nothing less from the creator of 
IPython, but every demo in his lecture tied together and made sense perfectly, especially about why 
we're doing what we're doing - collaborative and reproducible data science.

Our current analyzer group seems to have some sort of overlap with another visualizer group, in the 
sense that we're tacking the same problem, but I think that would be nice since we will have two 
different approaches (and maybe even two different results) to the same MDA Analysis problem. 
We plan to meet on Monday when everyone is back in town, and hopefully can crank up something for the 
final project demo at the Data Science Faire in less than two weeks!
