I missed class on Tuesday due to a (terrible) assumption that classes would be cancelled following 
what happened on Monday... I did catch up quite a bit, however, and learned that we have formed teams 
of Analyzers, Curators, Visualizers, and Presenters. Looks super exciting!

Thursday was great! I think I understand our ultimate goal in the class a bit more after attending 
Prof. Stark's lecture. 

* Aha moment: when I was finally able to connect to `gspread`. Turns out that the predefined key 
generated for us on bConnected doesn't work well. I ended up tinkering and generating my own key, 
and voila, IT WORKS! 

* What should be done differently: I don't know... I'm kinda worried actually. The assignment is due 
on Monday night, and my group doesn't meet until Sunday, and we only schedule for a two-hour meeting. 
With everyone new to Python and whatnot, I feel like this is going to take a while... But after all, 
if we can endure this pain early-on, things will be much easier once everyone gets used to the whole 
process by the end of class for the big research project.

* Comments: I feel like the class started out pretty slow for the last four weeks, but then suddenly pick 
up pace last week. People have to learn a whole new bunch of tools with little guidance. 
With a moderate CS background, I'm fine 
with that, but I'm not sure how the class as a whole feels. All I can say is, this is going to be a 
super steep learning curve, but I know it will be very worth it in the end.
