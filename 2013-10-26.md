This past week was mildly interesting to say the least. During last weekend, there were tons of people, 
including myself, hanging out in Soda to work on the project. Everyone was extremely collaborative, 
and I like the fact that there's no right or wrong answer in this class, so there was no pressure trying 
to game the autograder like some certain CS classes...     

Tuesday was fun when people tried to reproduce other group's work... What seems to bother me a bit was that 
reproducibility seems to be stressed in-class only. I'm wondering why Aaron and the staff put it as a small 
homework assignment, instead of putting valuable class time into cloning and running other groups' projects. 
This, much like installing the VM earlier in the semester, is something we can all do at home as a small 
assignment, and class time can be better spent on going over more important concepts.

To be honest, I don't like Thursday much. I love how there's no grade stress in this class mostly, but then 
the instructors brought up grading issues and participation/attendance on Thursday... I think it's extremely 
unnecessary, and this is something that should be discusses at the very beginning of the class, not on a 
random Thursday when most people were absent. I also don't like the idea of taking attendance when most 
people are also not there... it's like rubbing salt to the people who were already sick, busy, or absent for 
whatever reasons and make them stress out about grades. Granted that they should email the instructors 
beforehand, but sometimes things do slip our mind...

We went on to discuss the final project, but I'm pretty sure, judging on the look on people' faces, 
that nobody really has a concrete idea of what needs to be done. Granted that it's open-ended, I feel like 
we should have some specific action plans of every week from now till the end of the semester instead. For 
example, the data curators could look into possible data mines and report in on Github, the visualizers could 
spend sometime playing around with creating maps and plotting GeoJSON data (even though part of it is done in 
the last assignment), etc. Simply creating the final project on top of the notes that we all took during 
Professor Stark's lectures seem quite impossible to me... not to mention most of us wrote down the exact same 
thing from his lecture slides (then why don't we just build the final project based on the lecture slides?). 
I'm not entirely sure how the notes are going to be helpful, given that the specification is completely 
ambiguous...

**What I learned throughout last week**: I think most importantly, I got my feet wet with a few new Python libraries 
like Pandas and Folium. They are extremely interesting, and I'm sure there are a lot of things/side projects I 
can work on after this class. By lurking on Github and helping out people here and there, I also sharpen my own 
problem solving skills and learn to reproduce people' bugs on my machine to debug it. After all, if I'm going to 
be a software engineer, and someday a client/coworker/boss calls and reports a potential bug, this is what I'm 
gonna have to do, right? :D It's like an overview of real life haha.
