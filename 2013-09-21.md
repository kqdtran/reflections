We have two guest speakers this week: [Eric Berlow](http://ericlberlow.net/) and 
[Philip Stark](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/). I would say it's a breath of
fresh air after spending a couple of weeks installing stuff and getting everyone 
on the same page. Both speakers are very enjoyable overall, and I would definitely 
look forward to having more guest speakers in future weeks.
