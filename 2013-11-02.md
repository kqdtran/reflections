I feel like we did a bunch of talking this week, but didn't get much done. We discussed different ideas and 
SMART goals, but I don't think everyone has a clear idea of what needs to be done/achieved. Perhaps I'm wrong 
in saying this, but I think most of us are more familiar with a project with a clear specification, so 
when we are thrown an open-ended project with very little guidance (except for "resources are out there, go 
find them"), things will be much more difficult. But in the end, let's hope it's going to be a great learning 
experience...

I don't have much else to say since it was a week with very little work. Aside from the dense research paper 
and digging into some Matlab source code which most of us don't understand, I still find the whole thing to 
be very vague and confusing. We did form a new group, and I'm excited to work with my new groupmates and 
tackle this project. We'll see how things turn out on Tuesday.
